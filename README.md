Kaggle link of dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments

Motivation: When a patient doesnâ€™t show-up for a booked appointment, it not only wastes valuable time and money spent by government on Health-care but also deprives another patient of the opportunity. If we could predict likelihood of a patient bunking an appointment with high accuracy, we can come up with an arrangement to do tentative allocation of appointments to next day or next slot patients or we can come up with a system of cross check and confirm appointment before few hours.

Data: The data has 110K rows with 14 variables.
The average probability of not showing up for an appointment - 0.20193

Objective: Given above kaggle dataset, develop a model which could predict if a patient is likely to not show up for an appointment.
I have developed a voting based ensemble model which is giving f1-score of 0.87.
